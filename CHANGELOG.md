# Changelog

## 2026-04-02
- Fixed shared URL progressions to actually load into the app state.
  - `?p=` is decoded and the resulting chords/metadata are written to Zustand via `setCurrentProgression()`
  - syncs `genre`, `octave`, `count`, and `detectedKey`
  - resets playback state and removes the `p` query param to avoid re-processing
  - Location: `client/src/App.jsx`

- Fixed `Space` shortcut to start/stop audio playback.
  - The shortcut now calls the `AudioEngine` playback methods (instead of only toggling UI state).
  - Location: `client/src/App.jsx`
